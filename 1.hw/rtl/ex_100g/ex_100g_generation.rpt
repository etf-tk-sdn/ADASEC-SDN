Info: ex_100g_inst.atx_pll_s100: For the selected device(1SX280HU2F50E1VG), PLL speed grade is 2.
Info: ex_100g_inst.caui4_xcvr: The TX PCS-Core Interface FIFO is operating in full-rate transfer mode.
Info: ex_100g_inst.caui4_xcvr: The RX PCS-Core Interface FIFO is operating in full-rate transfer mode.
Info: ex_100g_inst.caui4_xcvr: For the selected device(1SX280HU2F50E1VG), transceiver speed grade is 2 and core speed grade is 1.
Info: ex_100g_inst.caui4_xcvr: Simplified data interface has been enabled. The Native PHY will present the data/control interface for the current configuration only. Dynamic reconfiguration of the data interface cannot be supported. The unused_tx_parallel_data and unused_tx_control ports should be connected to 0.
Info: ex_100g_inst.caui4_xcvr: For current configuration, TX PCS FIFO depth is "16" and TX Core FIFO depth is "32".
Info: ex_100g_inst.caui4_xcvr: For current configuration, RX PCS FIFO depth is "16" and RX Core FIFO depth is "64".
Info: ex_100g_inst.caui4_xcvr: "PCS clkout" (pcs_clkout) is selected to drive tx_clkout port and the clock frequency is 402.832031 MHz.
Info: ex_100g_inst.caui4_xcvr: "pma_div_clkout" is selected to drive tx_clkout2 port and it should not be used for register mode data transfers (Relevant parameter: "Selected tx_clkout2 clock source" (tx_clkout2_sel)).
Info: ex_100g_inst.caui4_xcvr: "PCS clkout" (pcs_clkout) is selected to drive rx_clkout port and the clock frequency is 402.832031 MHz.
